Abstract:
Pac-Man is one of the most popular game in the world.
The goal of this game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots inthe maze,
completing that ’stage’ of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots.
There are several ghosts roaming the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. 
If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man, the game is over.
The project is a remade version of Pac Man as a 3D game. It has been made using Unreal Engine 5.
It uses default third-person mechanics to control the character.
The game showcases 1 level (For now I have made only 1 level and am working on creating more).
You can easily create a new level by duplicating the level1 file making the changes to the maze as you want it to.
The game will end once you collect all the pac-dots. This way you will win the game.
You will lose the game if the ghost collides with you or if you fall off the maze. You can click on retry to start again.
To exit the game, navigate to Main Menu and click on quit game.
